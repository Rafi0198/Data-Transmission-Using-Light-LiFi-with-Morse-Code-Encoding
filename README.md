# Data-Transmission-Using-Light-LiFi-with-Morse-Code-Encoding
Description: Text is transmitted between Tx-Rx using light pulses. A string consists of 8bit ASCII characters. So the input string is transmitted character by character where each character is a byte or 8 bits. The photo detector at the receiver end decodes the received bit sequence to characters and eventually to string. Proper synchronisation between Tx-Rx is achieved by using the START bit at the beginning of each transmission. The sampling time or the bit duration must be the same at both Rx-Tx ends. The received string is then encoded with Morse Coding. The range of communication can be increased by using powerful LASER or by using an optical fibre as the communication medium.
